# Hi there!! :wave:
I love TypeScript, Hono and Deno!!  
I'm learning English little by little, but for now I'm relying on DeepL translation.

## Organization
### [WhyK Archive](https://github.com/whyk-archive)
Repositories that are known not to be maintained in the long term will be archived and moved to this organization without being deleted.

In some cases, development may resume in some form, only to be no longer maintained in the long term.

### [WhyK Playground](https://github.com/whyk-pg)
When you want to try out a new product, there is a concern that trial and error in the library repository will make it difficult to search and make commits dirty.

Therefore, we have consolidated repositories for verification and learning purposes into this organization for easier viewing.  
Learning and simple verification are prefixed with "learn-" as a repository prefix, and complex verification is prefixed with "verify-".

Incidentally, repositories that have not been updated for a long time are moved to the WhyK Archive.
